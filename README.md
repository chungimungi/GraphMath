# GraphMath

GraphMath using a  Graph AutoEncoder (GAE) to process and analyze mathematical problems. The NuminaMath-CoT dataset is used for both training and testing.
## Features

- Utilizes the NuminaMath-CoT dataset for training and testing
- Implements a Graph Autoencoder (GAE) with GCN and GAT layers
- Converts textual math problems into graph representations
- Predicts solution length using a combination of graph encoding and regression

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/chungimungi/GraphMath.git
