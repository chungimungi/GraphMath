# GraphMath

GraphMath using a  Graph AutoEncoder (GAE) to process and analyze mathematical problems. It leverages the NuminaMath-CoT dataset and employs advanced graph-based architectures to understand and predict solution characteristics for mathematical problems.

## Features

- Utilizes the NuminaMath-CoT dataset for training and testing
- Implements a Graph Autoencoder (GAE) with GCN and GAT layers
- Converts textual math problems into graph representations
- Predicts solution length using a combination of graph encoding and regression

## Installation

Clone the repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/graphmath.git
cd graphmath
pip install -r requirements.txt
